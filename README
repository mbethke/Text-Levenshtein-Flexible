Text-Levenshtein-Flexible version 0.05
======================================

Yet another Levenshtein module written in C, but a tad more flexible than the rest.

This module uses code from PostgreSQL's levenshtein distance function to provide the following features on top of plain distance calculation as it is done by Levenshtein::XS and others:

* Distance-limited calculation: if a certain maximum distance is exceeded,
the algorithm aborts without result. This helps performance in situations where
it is clear that results over a certain maximum are not useful.

*  Configurable costs for insert, delete ans substitute operations. The
traditional Levenshtein algorithm assumes equal cost for insertion and deletion
but modifying these allows preferential correction of certain errors.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:
